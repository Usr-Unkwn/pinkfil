Dear Grace,

Happy Birthday! 

    I know nasabi ko na ito ilang beses or not? But thank you talaga for making my school life fun and enable me to enjoy my youth as much as I can. Without you, I probably wouldn't realize how much I lost so many times to create memories in the past, so thank you for giving me the best memories.

    I learn a lot from you for this school year...You were my first friend who taught me how to cook, guide me when I'm lost in my own litte world, and help me when I'm struggling with stuff I'm not used to.
        
    I honestly don't know how to express my gratitude in a long time...so hopefully through this simple memory-look back, may it accompany you for a long time.


        <div class="signature">
            Sincerely,
            Iori
